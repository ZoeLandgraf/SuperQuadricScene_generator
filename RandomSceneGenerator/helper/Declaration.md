The Software used in this folder is taken from the following project [MoreFusion](https://github.com/wkentaro/morefusion)

MoreFusion is an object-level reconstruction system that builds a map with known-shaped objects,
exploiting volumetric reconstruction of detected objects in a real-time, incremental scene
reconstruction senario. It is based on the techniques described in the following publication:
